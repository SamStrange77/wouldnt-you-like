Wouldn't You Like: A guessing game based on EPIC: The Musical by Jorge Rivera-Herrans, and inspired by https://my-shot.net (The Hamilton Equivalent).

There are three modes:

Song: A random song from EPIC: The Musical is chosen, and a random word from somewhere in the song is displayed. You will guess which song you think it is. Each incorrect guess reveals an additional word after the previous one, until you guess the correct song or run out of guesses.

Lyric: A random song from EPIC: The Musical is chosen, and a random word from somewhere in the song is displayed. You will guess the NEXT word. Each incorrect guess reveals an additional word before the previous one. The word you have to guess is still the word after the INITIAL clue. This will continue until you guess the correct word or run out of guesses.

Audio: A random song from EPIC: The Musical is chosen, and a random snippet of 0.5s from somewhere in the song is displayed. You will guess the song. Each incorrect guess gives you an extra 0.5s of playtime to guess the song (starting from the original starting point). This will continue until you guess the song or run out of guesses. If the song doesn't play, click on the play button a few more times.
